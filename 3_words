The three words for Italy that best describe the country are, in my opinion:
Historic: Culture, art and history are everywhere; a feast for the eyes and for the soul
Passionate: From the cadence of spoken Italian to the lovers on the streets, Italians are passionate about everythingand, I struggled to come up with a third word – there are so may I could choose from (dirty, technophobic, diverse, etc) but I finally settled on:
Colorful: Everywhere, color saturated the landscape, and in certain places (Venice and Liguria) the light was unlike any I have ever seen before, making it a photographer’s dream come true
